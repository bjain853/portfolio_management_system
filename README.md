# Portfolio Management System
## Intro
This project is based on Forage's Well Fargo Software Development work experience course where requirements for a portfolio management system were described. I decided to extend this project into a full blown portfolio management system, complete with database integration and a frontend application, providing features like Login/Registering new advisors, seeing portoflio summaries overall and clientwise, getting daily updated prices for specific types of securities and more. 

## Tech stack used:
### Backend
Kotlin with springboot and MySQL
### Frontend
ReactJS with ChakraUI
